# QMCkl: Quantum Monte Carlo Kernel Library

![Build Status](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/workflows/test-build/badge.svg?branch=main)

The domain of quantum chemistry needs a library in which the main
kernels of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are implemented. In the
library proposed in this project, we expose the main algorithms in a
simple language and provide a standard API and tests to enable the
development of high-performance QMCkl implementations taking
advantage of modern hardware.

See the [source code](https://github.com/TREX-CoE/qmckl/tree/main/src)
to read the documentation.
