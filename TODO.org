* Set up CI on Travis
* Write tests

* malloc/free : Parameters for accelerators?
We should define qmckl_malloc and qmckl_free just to give the
possibility of the HPC implementations to define how they allocate the
memory (on CPU or GPU, using alternatives to malloc/free, etc).
A possibility could be to pass the id of a NUMA domain as a parameter of
qmckl_malloc, where the domain id is something obtained from the
context.


* TRANSA, TRANSB
* Performance info
* Benchmark interpolation of basis functions
* Complex numbers
* Adjustable number for derivatives (1,2,3)

* Put pictures
* Make the Makefile part of the documented code ?
* Put the data-flow graph in the code.
